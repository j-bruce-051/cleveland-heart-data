This should run from inside the heart_disease dir by running:

$python main.py

The file package-list.txt is the versions of packages installed in the environment in which I ran this. Running

$ conda create --name <env> --file package-list.txt 

should recreate the environment in conda. This uses Python 3.8.8.


Results of the various experiments should output to your terminal window and a comparison graph of the performances of different feature sets should pop up, 
these don't save automatically (as I was generating several) so if you want to view these without it running, please manually save it.
